## Problem 1

``` r
bday_sim = function(n) {
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n
  return(duplicate)
}

sim_res = expand_grid(
  n = 2:50,
  iter = 1:10000
) |>
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |>
  group_by(n) |>
  summarize(prob = mean(res))

sim_res_plot = sim_res |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Probability of Shared Birthdays as a Function of Group Size",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of at least two people sharing a birthday"
  )

sim_res_plot
```

The probability of shared birthdays increases sharply as the group size
grows. As the group size reaches around 50, the probability approaches
nearly 100%, indicating that itâ€™s almost certain that at least two
people in the group will share a birthday.

## Problem 2

``` r
sim_power = function(mu, n = 30, sigma = 5, alpha = 0.05) {
  sim_data = 
    tibble(
      x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
      )
  
  t_test = t.test(sim_data$x, mu = 0)
  result = broom::tidy(t_test)
  
  out_df = tibble(
    estimate = result$estimate,
    p_value = result$p.value
  )
  
  return(out_df)
}
```
